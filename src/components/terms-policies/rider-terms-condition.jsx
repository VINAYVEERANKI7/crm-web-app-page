            location to your chosen drop-off location on the Comride App.

            All payments, refunds, and cancellations are transactions between
            you and the Driver, to the total exclusion of Comride.
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll need to quote an offer price to the Driver using the Comride
            App's functionality for the route and approximate distance for which
            you require services. Driver can either reject or accept your offer
            price, forming a binding contract between you and the Driver.
            Drivers may also counter-offer your quote, which you can accept or
            reject.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you and your chosen Driver have agreed on the fee and confirmed
            it on the Comride App, it will form a binding contract between you
            and the Driver for the agreed-upon services from your chosen pick-up

            Comride may display an estimated price range based on market rates
            for the route and approximate distance you've chosen on the
            Platform, which you can use as guidance for your offer price.
            However, Comride makes no guarantee or warranty regarding the
            accuracy or reliability of the displayed price and provides such
            information for guidance only.

            Comride may display estimated price ranges based on market rates for
            the chosen route and approximate distance, serving as guidance for
            the Driver to quote or accept the offer price. However, Comride
            doesn't guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the displayed price
            and provides it for guidance only.

            subscription fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Driver will issue appropriate invoices, including under
            applicable goods and services tax laws, to the User for the
            services. Comride will not issue any invoices to the User as
            transactions are settled directly between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Driver acknowledges that Comride is not responsible for the
            settlement of any payments owed by or to the User.

          <li>
            These terms are subject to prevailing statutory taxes, and the
